# Should we use React.js, or some other dynamic UI library? 

Currently experimenting with React. 
Issues with it: 
- It seems quite big/heavy, or at least that the development environment has a ton of dependencies. Will it be possible/easy to integrate something built with React into a Reveal.js plugin? 
- I'm not wild about writing my code in a not-pure-javascript language (JSX), to then be transpiled. Maybe I should just accept this as a fact of life. 

Here are some other alternatives, ranked in order of... how they sound to me at first glance: 
- Ember
- Backbone
- Mithril
- Riot
- Svelte

- Vue
- Inferno
- Preact
- Angular


# I'm still not totally married to Paper.js, although it's gotten me this far.

If you have time some time, look further into Easel.js (part of Create.js), and also into using SVG.
